#  This is the flight code for the PICTURE-C flight computer.    #

OVERVIEW
 - The PICTURE-C computer serves as the only uplink/downlink console to the flight electronics.
 - The flight software consists of a single executable (bin/watchdog) that launches many sub-processes
   to control all of the hardware elements.
 - The watchdog monitors all sub-processes and kills/restarts them if there is a problem.

TELEMETRY INTERFACES
 - RS232 @ 1200 baud uplink and downlink
 - 4Mbps 16bit parallel data written out by the RTD DM7820 FPGA and encoded by the WFF93 encoder. 

DEFINITIONS
 - SCI: Flight 1 Science camera
 - LYT: Lyot LOWFS camera
 - SHK: Shack-Hartmann LOWFS camera
 - ACQ: Acquisition camera
 - DIA: Diagnostic
 - HEX: Hexapod
 - MOT: Motor
 - SRV: Non-Flight data server
 - THM: Thermal
 - TLM: Flight telemetry
 
 
LIST OF PROCESSES
 - watchdog
    - launch and monitor all other processes and to start the cameras
    - provides a console to receive terminal commands

 - tlm_proc
    - sends image packets down through the parallel interface
    - all packets share a common header, which contains information to indentify the image

 - sci_proc
    - operates the SCI camera

 - lyt_proc
    - operates the LYT camera

 - shk_proc
    - operates the SHK camera

 - acq_proc
    - operates the ACQ camera

 - hex_proc
    - operates the PI hexapod

 - mot_proc
    - operates the door motors

 - thm_proc
    - runs the thermal control system
    - cycles heaters on and off
    - records temperature sensor data

 - srv_proc
    - non-flight data server
    - sends full image data over ethernet

 - dia_proc
    - default diagnostic program (placeholder)

 - getshk_proc
    - a diagnostic program that is used to get SHK events during calibration

SETTINGS
 - Most settings are held in the global header file: ./src/controller.h
    - this is where you turn hardware on and off
 - Operational settings are held in ./src/watchdog.h
    - this is where you turn processes on and off

BUILD INSTRUCTIONS
 - make drivers
 - make libs
 - make
 
RUN INSTRUCTIONS
 - cd bin/
 - sudo ./watchdog
