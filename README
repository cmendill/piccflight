#****************************************************************#
#   This is the flight code for the PICTURE-C flight computer.   #
#  More detailed documentation can be found in the doc/ folder.  #
#****************************************************************#

OVERVIEW
 - The PICTURE-C computer serves as the only uplink/downlink console to the flight electronics.  

TELEMETRY INTERFACES
 - RS232 @ 1200 baud uplink and downlink
 - 4Mbps 16bit parallel data written out by the RTD DM7820 FPGA and encoded by the WFF93 encoder. 

HARDWARE CONTROL
 - Science and wavefront sensor cameras (via CTU commands).
 - Nuller PZTs (3xs316)
 - Nuller DM (1024 ch)

DEFINITIONS
 - SCI: Flight 1 Science camera
 - LYT: Lyot LOWFS camera
 - SHK: Shack-Hartmann LOWFS camera
 - ACQ: Acquisition camera
 - 

PC104 STACK
 - CPU: Versalogic Baycat
 - TLM: RTD DM7820 FPGA
 - CL1: Camera link 1 --> SH LOWFS
 - CL2: Camera link 2 --> Lyot LOWFS
 - AD1: Analog to digital converter 1
 - AD2: Analog to digital converter 1
 - AD3: Analog to digital converter 1
 - RB1: Relay board 1
 - RB2: Relay board 2
 
LIST OF PROCESSES
 - watchdog
    - watchdog: launch and monitor all other processes and to start the cameras
      provides a console to receive terminal commands

 - tlm_proc
    - telemetry: sends image packets down thru the paralell interface
    - all packets share a common header, which contains information to indentify the image

 - hsk_proc
    - poll the CTU for housekeeping data


LIST OF DRIVERS
 - RTD DM7820
    - uses the stock DM7820 driver
    - writes data to the FPGA FIFO using DMA

OTHER CODE
 - src/lib/
    - functions used by many processes
    - src/lib/common_functions.c
    - code for shared mem, circular buffer, sockets, image deinterlacing, changing camera modes
 - src/scripts/
    - shell scripts

SETTINGS
 - Most settings are held in the global header file: ./src/lib/controller.h
    - this is where you turn hardware on and off
 - Operational settings are held in ./src/wat/watchdog.h
    - this is where you turn processes on and off

BUILD INSTRUCTIONS
 - type: make all
 - binaries are written into the bin folder

RUN INSTRUCTIONS
 - cd bin/
 - ./watchdog
