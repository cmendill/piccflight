#****************************************************************#

OVERVIEW
 - The PICTURE-C computer serves as the only uplink/downlink console to the flight electronics.  

TELEMETRY INTERFACES
 - RS232 @ 1200 baud uplink and downlink
 - 4Mbps 16bit parallel data written out by the RTD DM7820 FPGA and encoded by the WFF93 encoder. 

HARDWARE CONTROL
 - Science Camera
 - Acquisition Camera

DEFINITIONS
 - SCI: Flight 1 Science camera
 - LYT: Lyot LOWFS camera
 - SHK: Shack-Hartmann LOWFS camera
 - ACQ: Acquisition camera

PC104 STACK
 - CPU: Versalogic Baycat
 - TLM: RTD DM7820 FPGA
 - CL1: Camera link 1 --> SH LOWFS
 - CL2: Camera link 2 --> Lyot LOWFS
 - AD1: Analog to digital converter 1
 - AD2: Analog to digital converter 1
 - AD3: Analog to digital converter 1
 - RB1: Relay board 1
 - RB2: Relay board 2
 
LIST OF PROCESSES
 - watchdog
    - watchdog: launch and monitor all other processes and to start the cameras
      provides a console to receive terminal commands

 - tlm_proc
    - telemetry: sends image packets down thru the paralell interface
    - all packets share a common header, which contains information to indentify the image

 - hsk_proc
    - poll the CTU for housekeeping data


LIST OF DRIVERS
 - RTD DM7820
 - Active Silicon Pheonix (phx) Framegrabber
 - FLI USB
 
LIST OF LIBRARIES
 - PI C887 Hexapod
 - ALPAO DM
 - Active Silicon Pheonix (phx) Framegrabber
 - RTD DM7820

SETTINGS
 - Most settings are held in the global header file: ./src/controller.h
    - this is where you turn hardware on and off
 - Operational settings are held in ./src/watchdog.h
    - this is where you turn processes on and off

REQUIRED PACKAGES
 - cmake (apt-get install cmake)
 - libusb (apt-get install libusb-1.0-0-dev, create simlink of /usr/include/libusb-1.0/libusb.h to /usr/include/libusb.h)

BUILD INSTRUCTIONS
 - type: make
 - binaries are written into the bin folder
 - After installing the drivers to /lib/modules insert driver names into /etc/modules for auto-loading

RUN INSTRUCTIONS
 - cd bin/
 - ./watchdog
